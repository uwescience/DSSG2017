I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle.
My research involves the prediction and analysis of pollutants in several combustion systems, such as natural gas engines, coal fired power plants, and wood burning cookstoves. I also enjoy playing tennis, hiking, and composing, recording and playing music. 

This summer I will be working on the studying the problem of traffic congestion in downtown Seattle with the Traffic Cruising team.
