I am veterinarian, ecologist, and currently a PhD candidate at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, studying the intersections of wildlife health, behavior, and conservation. I specifically work with one of the most adorable (yet spazzy) marsupials you've never heard of - the critically endangered woylie (a.k.a. [brush-tailed bettong](http://www.australianwildlife.org/wildlife/woylie.aspx)). I am very excited to be at the UW eScience Institute this summer, surrounded by a bevy of enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and dedicated colleagues and mentors.

My main focus for the fellowship is working with the team from [Vital Signs](http://www.conservation.org/projects/Pages/Vital-Signs.aspx), who employ a data-driven approach to sustainable agricultural development in Africa that emphasizes the balance between agriculture, nature, and human well-being. Keep your eye out for posts later this summer as the project develops! I am excited to expand my domain and technical skills, learning from leaders in the field while contributing to such a worthwhile cause. Not to mention brushing up on my Kiswahili! In my free time, I look forward to exploring Seattle, getting to know my new eScience colleagues, and catching up with old friends.
