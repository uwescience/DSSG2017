Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) supplement the incomes of rural
people throughout Africa. According to some estimates, NTFPs provide
income for over two-thirds of Africa's 600 million people (CIFOR 2005).
Some NTFPs, such as shea, are exported to international markets after
being collected in local forests. Others, like fuelwood and building
materials, are sold in local markets. Whether a part of the global
economy or local economies, NTFPs are a major income source: a
literature review of 51 case studies across 17 developing countries
showed that, on average, forests provide 22% of a households total
income and that households with less income were most dependent on
forest resources (Vedeld et al. 2007).

Many VitalSigns communities rely on natural resources in their daily
lives, including both food (e.g., fish) and other items (e.g., building
materials). These resources can potentially improve multiple aspects of
wellbeing, including nutrition, finances, health, and housing (Ahenkan
and Boon 2011; C. Shackleton and Shackleton 2004). We examined
self-reported collection of natural resources across VitalSigns
communities in Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. While non-food items
are highly valuable and often collected (particularly building materials
and medicinal plants), in this blog we will focus specifically on
collection of natural foods. These natural foods may provide
supplemental nutrition (particularly when agricultural yields are low),
expand dietary diversity, and allow individuals to save money they
otherwise would have spent on purchasing food.

Nuts or seeds, bushmeat, and honey were the foods collected by the
greatest number of households, with nuts/seeds being by far the most
frequently collected. Overall, there was very little collection of
natural food reported in Rwanda and Tanzania, perhaps due to stricter
protection of natural areas in these countries. Of course, it must be
considered that self-reporting of collection may be less reliable in
areas where such activities are illegal (Gavin, Solomon, and Blank
2010).

We were interested in whether collection of natural foods saved people
money, allowing them to spend more on non-food items. Due to the low
volume of collection reported in Rwanda and Tanzania, this analysis
focused exclusively on Ghana and Uganda. We looked at the relationship
between the estimated value of collected natural foods (in USD) and the
proportion of a household's budget that went towards food. Here, the
estimated value was based on how much individuals indicated they would
spend on an item at a market if they could not collect it multiplied by
the number of times they typically collected it in a year (e.g., 52 if
they collected weekly). If an individual said they collected an item but
would not buy it at the market, we used the average value placed on that
item for that specific community. Thus, these values may be
underestimates, as people might buy different items at market if natural
foods are unavailable (e.g., goat meat may be cheaper than bushmeat in
many markets). Yet, the data still showed a significant relationship,
with households that collected a greater value of natural foods spending
a smaller proportion of their budget on food. This finding may suggest
that availability of such resources allow families to save money on food
and increase investment in other expenditures (e.g., home improvements,
agricultural tools). Alternately, it is possible that families that
cannot afford to spend much on food (e.g., if a family member is sick
and has extensive medical expenses) are more likely to seek out natural
foods, which may help buffer against hunger in hard times (C. Shackleton
and Shackleton 2004).

<br> <br>

Regardless of the underlying cause of this relationship, it is clear
that natural foods are a valuable resource for many communities in
Uganda and Ghana. Yet, when asked about the availability of such
resources today relative to five years ago, by far the majority of
natural foods were reported to be in decline. Thus, there is concern
that current collection levels are unsustainable (whether due to
overharvest or land conversion). As VitalSigns gathers more data over
time, it will be helpful to better understand how collection of natural
items is changing and what factors or practices can best predict
sustainable use to ensure future availability of these valuable
resources. <br> <br>
