Congestion is troublesome in Seattle  
Getting downtown is such a battle  
So our team's going to do some fun math  
To understand the circling path  

Of people trying to find parking spots  
Without paying the price of private lots  
We have anonymized data of traffic flow:  
An aggregated view of where people go  

First, we're building a graph of the city  
Using Leaflet.js to make it pretty  
We're using some cool ML techniques  
Bringing out our inner python geeks  

Last week we went and visited first hand  
Our stakeholders and got the lay of the land  
After our field trip to the D-O-T  
Our vision is strengthened, we all can agree  

For now we are working on our database  
RethinkDB is perfect for the case  
We're continuing to expand our skillset  
Getting work done, don't you fret.
