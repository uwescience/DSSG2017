The Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative (CUAC) Summit took place at the University of British Columbia on July 13 and July 14. This
summit focused on bringing together the DSSG fellows and researchers from the University of Washington and University of British
Columbia as well as Microsoft representatives to discuss social good opportunities, projects, and research.

For the Cruising Team, this was an opportunity to discuss our project progression and share our ideas with the UBC DSSG fellows.In particular,
the fellows working on the Surrey Transportation Project discussed possible approaches for determining representative cruising signatures
through clustering and evaluating meaningful cost functions.

The CUAC Summit fostered an environment for meaningful communication and collaboration. The Cruising Team thanks UBC for graciously 
hosting us and Microsoft for their support.
