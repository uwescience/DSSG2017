My name is Jacob Rich. I am currently a rising senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I study mathematics, statistics, and economics. I work with a professor studying respondent-driven sampling and network clustering. I will be applying to graduate school this upcoming fall to pursue a Masters in statistics.

I was born in Chicago and grew up just outside the city in a suburb. I love Chicago, my first home, and Madison, my second home. I hope that the work that I do with the equity team can translate to skills and tools to help both Chicago and Madison: two very different cities with very different problems, but the same goal of equity for all. If I can be a small part of that, I will be happy.

Besides being an idealist, I am an unabashed political junkie and movie buff. You may also find me fighting with people about beer and taking long naps with my dog Lucy, the cutest and chubbiest husky-rottweiler.
